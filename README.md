# Where Was I

<b style="font-size: 20px;"><i>An app that solves this question once and for all!</i></b>

## Application Overview

Where Was I is a productivity application for those who want to keep track of where a user last left of on a project, an idea the user wants to expand upon at a later date, or anything that would benefit the user by simply writing down. Users can create notes within notebooks to do just this.

My goals for this application was to incorporate CRUD functionality and futher my understanding of how to use React Hooks.
